# What is this? 

This repository contains fixed files for PHP8 for some wordpress edit widgets used by themes from the collection 'ThinkUpThemes'. 
Also see https://wordpress.org/support/topic/think-up-themes-page-builder-critical-problem-with-php-v8/page/2/. 
The dropbox link shared there is out of date and no longer contains the 'new' page builder. 
People with some of the ThinkupThemes themes are left with errors in WP-Admin. 

## GPL. 

These widgets are based on https://github.com/siteorigin/siteorigin-panels, which is GPLv3. Therefore, even if ThinkUpThemes can't be bothered to fork and host their modified code, someone else can do so. 
This same GPL obliges us to share our modifications to make our client's sites function.

## This repository is partial. 

It doesn't contain the full site builder, because these themes come with only parts/bits of it, just enough to make them work. Fixed up files that are derivative works of siteorigin builder with it may be added.
